# Umbra

### Basics
- You are the cyan dot.
- The sun is dangerous.
- Your goal is to collect mushrooms (green dots), while staying in the umbra (darkest part) of the shadow.

### Controls
- Move with `arrow keys` or `wasd`.
- Pause with `Space`.

### Damage
- For every half second you are directly<sup>1</sup> in the sun, you take sunburn damage.
- The sun flares up every 5 to 15 seconds, dealing heavy damage if you are partially<sup>2</sup> or completely in the sun.
- You level up at every hundred points. The sun does more and more damage each time.

1. Direct sunlight means you can draw a line from the center of the sun to the center of the player without hitting an obstacle.
2. You can take partial damage by being partially in the sun. Damage is calculated by the percentage of the player's body that is in the sun.
